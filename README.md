# alexa-command-list
Some printable command lists for people using Amazon Echo devices, with an emphasis on important commands for elderly users with Amazon emergency service. 

The files are created in [Affinity Designer](https://www.affinity.studio/get-affinity) which is a fantastic and completely free design tool for Windows and MacOS with iPadOS support coming at some point in the future. 

The emergency help card files are 2 page documents designed for each page to be printed on half of a standard 8.5x11 inch paper using Affinity's fantastic print capabilities to print them as double-sided help cards with emergency info on one side and common useful commands on the other. If you have a capable printer with double-sided printing capability, each can be printed twice and then the page can be cut in half to make 2 cards. The idea is that you can print a bunch of cards and place them strategically around the house near your devices.
